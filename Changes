2004-10-08 - 2.2 Dieting
    
    Thanks to suggestion and patches from Adam Kennedy 
    Module::Pluggable has dumped some weight and got rid of 
    the none Core dependecies of File::Find::Rule and 
    UNIVERSAL::require


2004-08-25 - 2.1 Small buglette

    Require inner packages when appropriate. This helps towards
	making things work with PAR. Thanks to Brian Cassidy.

	Never released.
    
2004-08-19 - 2.0 Working inner packages

    As long as you have require or instantiate set then we'll also find
    inner packages. Why I didn't fix this way back in 1.3 I don't know.

2004-07-18 - 1.9 Add 'package' option

    This lets you install a method in another package's 
    namespace. Thanks to Simon Cozens.

2004-07-08 - 1.8 Fix those two options

    They worked before but now they're more robust.

2004-07-07 - 1.7 Add support for limiting plugins

    Added 'only' and ''except' options.

2004-06-03 - 1.6 Add a traditional Makefile.PL
    
    Even though I think Module::Build is much better.

2004-05-25 - 1.5 Build.PL stupidity

    Must add prereqs. Doh.

2004-05-25 - 1.4  Multiple instances

    Made it so you could use it twice in the same package.
    Removed the inner package stuff inorder to fix it properly.

2004-05-06 - 1.3  Ability to search in inner packages 

    Simon Cozens donated some code to allow us to search 
    inner packages.

2004-05-06 - 1.2  Fix minor buglet
    
    Apply a patch from Tom Insam to fix requiring without
    instantiating and make require failures more verbose.

2003-12-15 - 1.11 Update MANIFEST.
    
    So that make dist works properly.

2003-12-15 - 1.1  Make it work with multi level plugins

    Apparently Foo::Plugin::Bar::Quux doesn't work. 
    Thanks to Darren Chamberlain for spotting this.

2003-12-15 - 1.00 Add some more features
    
    Added the ability to require without instantiating (for Tom Insam)    
    Prevented the names from being explicitly sorted (again, for Tom Insam)
    Added in the ability to provide other search directorys.

2003-11-27 - 0.95 Some Test::More issues

    Explicitly number the tests which fixes some test more failures


2003-10-21 - 0.9  We can rebuild you, we have the technology
    
    Having used this in the wild some changes to make it better.


2003-10-20 - 0.8  Fix.
    
    Namespace issues.


2003-10-17 - 0.7  And take your Build.PL with you

    Pesky MANIFEST.SKIP


2003-10-15 - 0.6  Initial release

    Be free my pretty. EMANCIPIA!
